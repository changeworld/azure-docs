# Streaming Locators

To make videos in the output Asset available to clients for playback, you have to create a [Streaming Locator](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/streaminglocators) and then build streaming URLs. For .NET sample, see [Get a Streaming Locator](stream-files-tutorial-with-api.md#get-a-streaming-locator).

The process of creating a **Streaming Locator** is called publishing. By default, the **Streaming Locator** is valid immediately after you make the API calls, and lasts until it is deleted, unless you configure the optional start and end times. 

When creating a **Streaming Locator**, you must specify an **Asset** name and a **Streaming Policy** name. For more information, see the following topics:

* [Assets](assets-concept.md)
* [Streaming Policies](streaming-policy-concept.md)
* [Content Key Policies](content-key-policy-concept.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Properties of **Streaming Locators** that are of the Datetime type are always in UTC format.
> * You should design a limited set of policies for your Media Service account and reuse them for your Streaming Locators whenever the same options are needed. For more information, see [Quotas and limitations](limits-quotas-constraints.md).
